# ExploringSuperposition

This is the repo for exercises I did as part of this module: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/qsharp-explore-key-concepts-quantum-computing/

Particularly the part about superposition. This repo will be followed by exercises which are aimed towards interference concepts.

Cheers!
